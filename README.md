# IPT_code

To run the code, first it is necessary to compile analytical_continuation.f90 with the name 'pade.exe'
The necessary routines are contained in the library 'DMFT_IPT.py'. Any script should be run from a directory that contains './Pade/pade.exe'.
Alternatively, the path in the function 'pade_analytic_cont' should be modified.
